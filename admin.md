# Administration
In order to send commands to individual nodes instead of treating them as an intermediary, we should give each node a unique address. When there is a command card for a node and not a typical receiver, the card will be colored blue instead of white. Each blue card a node receives, it needs to check who the recipient is to see whether it is meant for them or meant to be passed on to another node. By color coding cards based on node commands vs typical receiver messages we can ensure some node efficiency in that it doesn't have to check every single card that comes through. When the card receives a blue card with its specific address it will perform the command present on the card.
