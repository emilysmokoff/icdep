# icdep
This is an assignment for INFO 314 at the University of Washington. The ICDEP stands for the Index Card Data Exchange Protocol. This models the way information is moved across nodes and on the internet, but in card form. The point of this assignment is imagining ways to improve the ICDEP to strengthen its reliability and accuracy.

You will find this assignment includes three files:
* **anti-dupe.md**: This file is focused on Anti-Duplication, all based on the question: how can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?
* **extension.md**: This file is focused on the question: how can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?
* **admin.md**: This file is focused on Administration, specifically the question: how can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?
