# Anti-Duplication
To prevent duplication of each card and to ensure that each card is received once and only once, I propose that as each card reaches the destination receiver, there is a check to ensure that the card received is not a duplicate number card in the sequence as the cards already received. For the destination receiver the cards should be put into order and double checked for duplicates by a system before the receiver sees the message, where the message is "checked". In the icdep, this would be a person who does so for the receiver, in a computer this would be a system that compiles the message for the receiver. In class, we agreed upon a system where the cards header showed the number of card it was in the sequence as a fraction of the total number of cards, so if I received card 7 out of 8 total cards it would have a 7/8 in the corner of the card as a part of the header. Using my solution, everytime a card is received the checker will check it  against every card already received to see if that number in the sequence has already been received, and if it was then you would throw away the second received copy, aka the card they had just received.

I propose doing it on the receiving end, and not throughgout the process, for efficiency. That way you check every card once and place the message in order for the receiver and do not have to check it as it is on route to the receiver at each node.
