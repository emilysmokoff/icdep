## Keep a Record of What Nodes the Card has Passed Through
In order to add this functionality without breaking the existing functionality, I believe that each node should have a unique braille stamp that it places on the card when it passes through the node. This way it does not alter the information on the card, nor make it hard to understand by covering it up with ink that would be required if you were to use a traditional stamp. You can then trace back the nodes the card traveled through by evaluating the unique braille stamps that were left on the card.
