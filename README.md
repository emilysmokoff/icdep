# icdep
This is an assignment for INFO 314 at the University of Washington. The ICDEP stands for the Index Card Data Exchange Protocol. This models the way information is moved across nodes and on the internet, but in card form. The point of this assignment is imagining ways to improve the ICDEP to strengthen its reliability and accuracy.
